Q2.List down common security vulnerabilities in PHP and explain them in detail ?

-->  1•SQL Injection
   SQL injection occurs when an attacker manipulates a SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code into an input field. 
   This can lead to unauthorized access to the database, data leakage, or even data modification/deletion. 

2• Cross-Site Scripting(XSS)
XSS occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into web pages that are then executed in a user's browser. 
This can steal cookies, session data, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

3• Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
CSRF forces a logged-in user to perform unwanted actions on a site 
where they are authenticated, leading to data modification or account hijacking.

4• Remote Code Execution
RCE allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on a server, leading to a complete system compromise.


5• File Upload Vulnerabilities
File upload vulnerabilities occur when an attacker uploads a malicious file to a server, 
leading to security risks such as Remote Code Execution (RCE),
Local File Inclusion (LFI), Directory Traversal, or Denial of Service (DoS).


6• Session Hijacking
Attackers steal a session ID and impersonate a logged-in user.

Prevention:

Use secure and HttpOnly cookies.
Implement session_regenerate_id() on login.
Use same-site cookies to prevent CSRF.


10• Weak Password Hashing
Storing passwords in plain text or using weak hashing (e.g., MD5, SHA1) makes them easy to crack.

Prevention:

Use password_hash() with Bcrypt or Argon2.
Enforce strong password policies.
