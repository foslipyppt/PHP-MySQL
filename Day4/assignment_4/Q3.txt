3. Explain OOPs Concepts in detail along with examples. 

Definition : OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects to model real- world entities and concepts. 
It organizes code into reusable and logical structures like classes and objects. 


        OOP Concepts in PHP 

1. Classes and Objects • Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects.
It defines properties (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects created from it will have.

• Object: An instance of a class. It has its own specific values for the properties defined in the 
class. 

2. Encapsulation : Encapsulation ensures data protection by restricting direct access to an object's properties and methods.
 It uses access modifiers to control visibility: 
•public:Accessiblefromanywhere.
•private:Accessibleonlywithintheclass. 
•protected:Accessiblewithintheclassandbyclassesderivedfromit. 

3. Inheritance • Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent).
 This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.
• Syntax:Usetheextendskeyword. 

4. Polymorphism :
• Polymorphism means "many forms." It allows methods in a class hierarchy to have the same 
name but behave differently based on the object calling them.
